## General Information
We work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.

The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

We have used EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

This dataset contain the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011., including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information.
